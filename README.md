## Description:

This is a functional example of a social network API created with MongoDB, with features to add users and thoughts, and to tinker with them as one wishes. Handy for storing the relevant values for later!

## Usage:

Since this is all serverside, one can run this by navigating to the command prompt and doing the following:

- Navigate to the directory of the API
- type in 'npm start'
- ???
- ...that's it.

For the purpose of trying out its functionality, a program like Insomnia is recommended.
